// one command line argument, a string specifying input file to read
// test: right number of arguments?
// test: file found and able to be opened for reading?

// the input file should contain ten lines
// each has 10 non-newline characters (plus a newline)
// test: test each 1-10 character to see if it is newline
// test: test that we only get 10 lines
// test: DO NOT cast the character to a char, check if it is EOF first

// use the rotate function we already wrote to rotate in input matrix
// set the related assignment
// print the rotated result on stdout


// if there are any errors, your program should
// print an error message to stderr and exit with exit failure
